# Streamlit 101

Ensure you have Streamlit installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

Run the Streamlit app by executing the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and open your default web browser to the app's URL, typically `http://localhost:8501`.
